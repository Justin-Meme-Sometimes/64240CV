            <p>
                This is just a convient place to describe my current life. This site grows as i grow.
                Also, why not here, it's a cool site the stack of this website will listed at some later point
                but it will constantly change as i find better or more interesting ways to morph this website into what i want.
                In a later section i speak about this site being almost like a living diary which is the vibe i'm trying to go for.
